<h1>What should you do to
prepare for your settlement
conference?</h1>


	<h2>STEP 1: CONTACT A HUD-APPROVED
	HOUSING COUNSELING AGENCY</h2>
		<p>Located
		in the front folder of this guidebook is a list of
		your local HUD-approved housing counseling
		agencies. If other companies or individuals
		tell you that they can help save your home
		if you pay them money, you should be
		suspicious – often times these are scammers
		who are trying to make a quick dollar at your
		expense. High quality and expert services
		are available for free from the agencies listed
		in this guide, and we recommend you contact
		one of them if you are looking for help.</p>
		
		
	<h2>STEP 2: GATHER ALL YOUR DOCUMENTS</h2>
		<p>You are required to bring some documents 
		with you to the Settlement Conference. There 
		are other documents the Bank will require 
		to review your loan. If you have already 
		submitted these documents (often called a 
		“loss mitigation” or “workout” package), 
		you should expect to submit them again. You should also gather all the documents 
		you received when you originally got the 
		loan (referred to as the “loan documents” or 
		“closing documents”) if you can locate them. 
		A list of documents to gather is included 
		below.</p>
		
		<table>
		<thead>
		<tr><th>&#x2713;</th><th>Documents to Gather</th></tr></thead>
		<tr><td></td><td>The last two months of pay stubs for 
											everyone who regularly helps pay the 
											mortgage</td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>If you receive rental income:
												Copies of your current lease AND
												Schedule E in tax returns AND/OR
												Bank statements showing regular rental 
												deposits AND/OR
												Copies of rent receipts you give to your 
												tenants AND/OR
												Section 8 or other subsidy agreements</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Tax returns for the last two years</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>If you receive money from the state 
										(social security, disability payments, VA 
										benefi ts etc) or a pension:
										Most recent award letter AND
										3 months worth of bank statements 
										showing deposits of this money OR
										3 months worth of payment stubs</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>If you are self-employed you should 
										If you are self-employed you should 
										have a profi t and loss statement 
										available for the last two quarters</p>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>If other people in your household 
												are contributing to the household 
												bills, copies of their paystubs/income 
												documents</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Your most recent utility bill that is listed 
												in your name</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Financial Form provided by the Bank</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Hardship letter 
											(This is a letter you write that explains 
											why you fell behind. You should indicate 
											in the letter if this was a temporary 
											setback, or if this is a permanent change 
											in your household income.)</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Your most recent mortgage statement</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Forbearance, loan modifi cation, or 
												workout off ers you have received, 
												regardless of whether you accepted or 
												rejected them</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>All papers and letters you have received 
											from the Court, the Bank, and the Bank’s 
											attorney</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Copies of your loan application (or the 
												Uniform Residential Loan Application)</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Your HUD-1 Settlement Statement</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>The Note and any riders (Balloon Rider 
												or Adjustable Rate Rider)</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Mortgage and riders</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement 
			</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Good Faith Estimate</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Your Deed</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Most recent appraisal (if you have one)</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td><p>Any other papers related to fees you 
												paid at closing, either to your lender or 
												your broker or anyone else</p></td></tr>
		
		</table>
		<p>If you cannot fi nd all these documents, 
		you should still GO TO THE SETTLEMENT 
		CONFERENCE. If there are documents the 
		Bank provided to you when you initially got 
		your loan (like the Note or the Mortgage) and 
		you don’t have a copy, you can request a copy 
		of them at the Settlement Conference.</p>
		
		
		<h2>STEP 3: COMPLETE YOUR BUDGET</h2>
		<p>The budget in this guide is only for your use. 
		No one else is going to see it unless you show 
		it to them. It is designed to help you make an 
		honest assessment if you can aff ord to keep 
		your home. This is also good preparation for 
		meeting with your housing counselor and 
		filling out your Bank’s fi nancial forms.</p>
		
		<h3>MONTHLY INCOME</h3>
		<p>First, you need to compute your total monthly 
				income. Listed below are the most common 
				sources of income. You want to list all of your 
				personal sources of income (Column A), as 
				well as any other income from anyone else in 
				your house if they are helping contribute to 
				the mortgage (Column B).</p>
		<p>Please remember that you MUST be able to 
					verify all the sources of income you use in the 
					budget. Your Bank will not consider sources 
					of income without accompanying verification. 
					If you are using another household member’s 
					income in your budget, count that person’s 
					expenses as well and make sure you have 
					verification of their income.</p>
			<p><strong>Gross Household Income:</strong> Adding 
					columns A and B gives you your “Total Gross 
					Household Income.” This amount is $_______. 
					Multiply this number by .31. This equals 
					$_________, and we will refer to this as your 
					“31% Payment”. Most of the large banks in 
					the country have recently settled on 31% as 
					being one of the main standards they use 
					in determining if a payment is affordable – 
					anything above 31% is often looked at as 
					being too high. Therefore, your 31% Payment 
					is an approximate amount you should </p>
				<img src="img/income-calculator.jpg">
				<p>expect to pay in total for your fi rst mortgage, 
						homeowners insurance, property taxes and 
						condo fees/homeowners association fees. 
						</p>
					<p>Remember, there is no law that says you 
							cannot pay more than 31% -- this is merely 
							meant as a guide to give you a better idea 
							of what many of the national banks have 
							recently done. In addition, if you were 
							paying less than this before you defaulted, 
							be prepared for your mortgage payment to 
							increase to this amount each month.</p>
					<p><strong>Net Household Income:</strong> Adding columns C 
							and D gives you your “Total Household Net 
							Income.” This amount is $_______. This is 
							how much you actually receive each month, 
							and the amount available to pay your bills.</p>
					<h3>MONTHLY EXPENSES</h3>
					<p>Now that we have looked at your income, 
							we need to compute your total monthly 
							expenses. Included on the next page (page 
							20) is a list of typical household expenses you 
							may have each month. Fill in each category 
							as best you can. We realize that it often can 
							be difficult to estimate certain categories, 
							such as how much you spend on food each 
							month. However, it is vital for you to fi ll this 
							out as accurately as possible. The only way 
							to make an accurate determination if you can 
							afford your home is to look at what else you 
							are spending your money on. You will likely 
							have to fill out a very similar form for your 
							Bank, so working on your budget now will 
							help you.</p>
							<img src="img/monthlyIncome.jpg">
							<p>Now take each of the subtotals from your 
								expense list and copy them in below.</p>
							<img src="img/monthlyTotals.jpg">
							<p>Next you need to calculate how much money 
							you have after you pay all your bills, or how 
							much more you are spending each month 
							than you are earning. Take your Total Net 
							Income, which you calculated earlier, and 
							subtract your Total Monthly Expenses, which 
							you just calculated</p>
							<img src="totalsCalculated.jpg">
							<p>If this amount is negative, it is referred to 
									as your “monthly defi cit”. If this amount is 
									positive, it is referred to as your “monthly 
									surplus”. If you have a monthly defi cit, do 
									you see any sources of income that you can 
									increase, or any expenses you may be able 
									to cut back on? In addition, look at the 31% 
									Payment we calculated earlier. If we plugged 
									the 31% Payment amount into your budget 
									in place of the current Monthly Mortgage 
									Payment, would that be enough to turn your 
									monthly defi cit into a monthly surplus? If not, 
									you may not be able to aff ord your home and  you should seriously consider other options 
									(such as a “short sale” or a “deed-in-lieu of 
									foreclosure”). 
									</p>
									
									
								<h2>STEP 4: TELL YOUR STORY</h2>
								<p>The reasons 
										you ended up in foreclosure are probably 
										long and complicated, and each borrower’s 
										situation is slightly diff erent. The Settlement 
										Conference is a chance for you to share 
										your story with the Court and the Bank. 
										By preparing to tell your story before the 
										Settlement Conference, it is more likely you 
										will tell your story in a way that everyone can 
										understand. They need to know why you are 
										in foreclosure, and what you have done to 
										resolve your situation. The clearer you are to 
										the Court and the Bank, the easier it will be to 
										resolve the foreclosure. You should write out 
										answers to the following questions:
										<ul>
										<li>What are the reasons for falling behind on 
												your mortgage? </li>
										<li>What have you done to try to keep your 
												home?</li>
											<li>Were there any terms of your loan that 
													were different than what you were 
													promised?</li>
										</ul></p>
										<p>You should also be able to talk about basic 
										information about your loan, such as the 
										following:</p>
										<p>The current monthly payments are $_____.
												The current interest rate is: ______% and my 
												interest rate (circle one) changes/does not 
												change. I last made a payment on my loan in 
												_______________ (list month and year).</p>
											<p>Have you attempted to work with your Bank 
												to find a solution already? If so, make a list 
												below of all the people you have contacted, 
												and the times you have sent in documents 
												before the Settlement Conference.</p>
												
<h2>ATTEND THE SETTLEMENT 
												CONFERENCE AND WORK TOWARDS A LOAN 
												MODIFICATION</h2>
												<p>NOTE TAKING PAGES: Bring this with you to 
														all the Settlement Conferences you go to, and 
														take notes during the conference.</p>
														
													<img src="img/notePage1.JPG">
													<p> 
													Before you leave, try to summarize your understanding of what happened at the Settlement 
													Conference, and what will happen next. Ask the Court to confi rm you are correct.</p>

														<h3>WORKING TOWARD A LOAN MODIFICATION</h3>
										
													<p>If your loan can be modifi ed there are several 
															ways your Bank will likely go about it. The 
															Bank may do any of the following: 
															<ul>
															<li>Lower your interest rate</li>
															<li>Convert an Adjustable Rate Mortgage to
															 a Fixed Rate Mortgage</li>
															 <li>Extend the term of the loan</li>
															 <li>Forgive a portion of your principal
															 balance</li>
															</ul>
															</p>
															<p>Regardless of which way the Bank considers, 
															they typically will modify a loan by doing a 
															“capitalization”. Capitalization occurs when 
															items owed on a loan (e.g. past due interest, 
															taxes, late charges, legal costs, etc.) are 
															added to the unpaid principal balance of 
															the loan and are treated as part of a new 
															principal balance. In adding them to the 
															unpaid principal balance, the Bank will 
															cause the overall amount that is owed to the 
															Bank on that loan to increase. The upside 
															to a capitalization is that because all current 
															outstanding charges have been rolled into 
															the unpaid principal balance, the Borrower 
															is now seen as current on their mortgage 
															payments. By doing a capitalization, the 
															homeowner does not have to make up all 
															missed payments at one time</p>
															<p>Any agreement you reach should clearly state 
															how much you owe, what your interest rate 
															will be going forward, what each charge is 
															for, what your monthly payment will be, how 
															long you will be making that payment, and 
															what will happen if either side violates the 
															agreement. Ask for a written explanation of 
															any and all charges that are part of this loan 
															modifi cation, and ask that attorney’s fees and 
															late fees be reduced or waived.</p>
