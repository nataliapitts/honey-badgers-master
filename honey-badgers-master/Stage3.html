<h1>STAGE 3: THE DEMAND LETTER</h1>
<p>The timing of when you will receive a 
&quot;Demand Letter&quot; depends on the language 
in your Mortgage, but typically this will 
occur when you are 45 to 60 days behind on 
payments. Although the Bank is threatening 
to begin a foreclosure proceeding if you 
do not pay and may even say that you are 
in foreclosure when you contact them, at 
this point they have not actually filed any 
documents with the Court.</p>
<p>It is important to note that you may receive 
a Demand Letter, even if you have contacted 
the Bank and have begun to work with them 
in trying to work out a plan to get current. 
You may have sent lots of documents to 
the Bank, which they are actively reviewing. 
Regardless of these efforts, you still may 
receive a Demand Letter. With many large 
banks, the Demand Letter is automatically 
generated when you fall behind by a certain 
amount of time on payments. Therefore, 
even if you are being reviewed for workout 
solutions, you still will receive the Demand 
Letter. It does not mean that the Bank 
has stopped reviewing your documents. 
Therefore, if the Bank has asked you for more 
documents, send them in - do not assume 
that process has ended.</p>
