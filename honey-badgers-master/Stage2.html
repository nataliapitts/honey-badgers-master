<h2>STAGE 2 : THE 90-DAY PRE-FORECLOSURE NOTICE</h2>
<p>The timing of when you will receive
a 90-Day Pre-Foreclosure Notice varies from
case to case, but typically if you fall 30 or
more days behind you will likely receive
this letter. Under New York State law, this
letter is required to be sent to you. The Bank
must wait at least 90 days from sending this
letter before they begin a foreclosure action
against you. This 90-day window gives you
the opportunity to try to work with the Bank
to fi nd an alternative to foreclosure. This
notice must tell you how much you must
pay to bring your loan current. It must also
provide the names and telephone numbers
of at least 5 not-for-profi t housing counseling
agencies serving your county. (You will fi nd
a list of local housing counseling agencies
for your area in the folder in the front of this
guidebook.)
If you are reading this guide, you most likely
have already received this notice. If you have
recently received this letter, we strongly urge
you to do one of two things: (1) Contact a
local housing counseling agency and make
an appointment to meet with them, as they
can help you through the process of working
with the Bank without any cost to you; or
(2) If you choose not to utilize the services of
a housing counseling agency, contact your
Bank directly. The longer you wait to work
with your Bank, the harder it will be for you to
keep your home!
