<h1>The stages of a foreclosure case</h1>
<p>A foreclosure proceeding is a long process
with many steps, and usually takes no less
than six months from start to fi nish. What
follows is a brief summary of the steps in a
foreclosure. After the brief summary, we will
then go into greater detail on each stage.</p>
<h2>STAGE 1: HOMEOWNER FALLS BEHIND ON PAYMENTS</h2>
<p>This can happen for any number of reasons, but the end result is the same: your financial situation is such that
you have not been able to keep current on
your Mortgage. Each Mortgage has specifi c
language about when the Bank may begin 
a foreclosure proceeding. For instance, we
often see mortgages that say if a homeowner
falls more than 3 months behind on
payments, the Bank can begin foreclosure
proceedings.</p>

<h2>STAGE 2: 90-DAY PRE-FORECLOSURE NOTICE</h2>
<p>Under New York State law, the Bank is
required to send you a notice at least 90 days
before the start of a foreclosure proceeding.
Typically, the Bank will send this out when
you are somewhere between 30 and 60 days
behind on your payments. Notices must
be sent to the last known address of the
borrower by registered or certifi ed mail, in
addition to fi rst-class mail. The letter must
state the number of days you are behind
on your Mortgage, the amount of money
owed and the telephone number of the
Bank. It also must provide a list of at least fi ve
government approved housing counseling
agencies in your area (as seen in the folder
at the front of this guidebook). If you are
reading this guide, you most likely have
already received this notice.</p>
<h2>STAGE 3: THE DEMAND LETTER (OR THE
“ACCELERATION LETTER”)</h2>
<p>This is a letter
sent by the Bank to the Borrower before
a foreclosure proceeding is fi led in Court,
pointing out that the terms of the Mortgage
have been violated due to nonpayment. You
will typically be given 30 days to pay the
delinquent amount and any associated late
fees.</p>
<h2>STAGE 4: THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT </h2>
<p>These documents will be the fi rst notice you
will receive that a foreclosure case has been
started with the court.</p>
<h2>STAGE 5 (OPTIONAL): FILING AN ANSWER </h2>
<p>This is a written statement you may choose
to prepare in response to the Summons and
Complaint. Typically, an Answer is only done
when you feel you have legal claims against
the Bank.</p>
<h2>STAGE 6: SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE </h2>
<p>This is an opportunity for you to sit down with
the Bank at your local courthouse to try to
work out an alternative to foreclosure so that
you may keep your home. You will fi nd out
about the time and date of the Settlement
Conference in a letter sent to you by the
Court.</p>
<h2>STAGE 7A: SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENT
CONFERENCE </h2><p> It is possible that you and the
Bank will work out an arrangement allowing
you to keep your home. If this happens, the
Bank will fi le a document called a “Cancellation
of Lis Pendens” that will end the foreclosure
proceeding in the court system.</p>
<h2>STAGE 7B: UNSUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENT
CONFERENCE </h2><p> If you and the Bank cannot
agree on an alternative to foreclosure, the
foreclosure will be allowed to move forward in
the court system. An “Order of Reference” will
likely be granted to the Bank. This allows the
Bank to obtain a “Judgment”, which will then
allow them to take ownership of the house
after an auction.</p>
<h2>STAGE 8: (IF SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE WAS
UNSUCCESSFUL) POST-JUDGMENT </h2><p> These
are the events that occur after Judgment has
been entered. Unless a last-minute deal with
the Bank is reached, this stage will end with
the house being sold at a public auction to the
highest bidder and you will have to move out
of your house.</p>
