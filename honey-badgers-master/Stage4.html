<h1>STAGE 4: SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT -</h1>
<p>The Summons and Complaint is what tells 
you that a lawsuit has been started. The 
Summons and Complaint are created by the 
Bank&apos;s attorneys, and throughout them you 
will be referred to as the Defendant. The 
Summons is usually one of the first pages, 
and tells you some basic information about 
the lawsuit that has been started. It will tell 
you the name of the entity that has filed the 
foreclosure against you. This may simply be 
the name of your Bank.</p>
<p>However, the name of the party suing you 
may be a long, confusing name that does 
not sound familiar to you. For example, you 
may see that the Plaintiff is &quot;MORTGAGE 
SERVICING AMERICA, AS TRUSTEE FOR 
MORTGAGE INDEX 2005-RD4, MORTGAGE 
PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES SERIES 2005-
RD4 UNDER THE POOLING AND SERVIING 
AGREEMENT DATED DECEMEBER 1, 2005.&quot; 
The example of a Summons that follows this 
section shows an example of one of these 
types of trusts.</p>
<p>The reason this sometimes happens is that 
your Bank may have taken your mortgage, 
bundled it with hundreds of others, and 
sold them on Wall Street. If that was the 
case, they created a &quot;Trust&quot; (which is a type 
of legal entity) that holds all the mortgages.
Therefore, when a foreclosure is fi led it has to 
be the Trust that actually is the Plaintiff .</p>
<h2>REGARDLESS OF WHOM YOU 
SEE LISTED AS THE PLAINTIFF, 
THERE WILL NOT BE ANY REAL-
WORLD DIFFERENCE IN HOW THE 
FORECLOSURE PROCEEDS.</h2>
<p>The Complaint tells you and the Court the 
reasons the Bank is suing you and what they 
are asking the Court to do. Because this is 
a foreclosure, the Bank is claiming you have
not made your monthly payments as you 
promised in your Mortgage and Note. When
you signed your Mortgage you put your 
house up as collateral, in case you could not 
pay the amount you borrowed. Now that you 
have fallen behind on your payments (also 
known as &quot;defaulting&quot;), the Bank is asking the 
Court to enforce the terms of the Mortgage. 
Terms of the Mortgage typically allow the 
Bank to sell your house if you default on your 
payments to them.</p>
<p>When you receive the Summons and 
Complaint, you should also receive a notice 
that again informs you that help is available 
through a housing counseling agency. This 
notice will be on a different colored paper, 
and in larger font. It should list all the HUD-
approved housing counseling agencies listed 
in the folder of this guidebook. If you have 
not contacted a housing counseling agency 
at this point, we once again <b><u>STRONGLY</b></u> urge 
you to contact one of them and make an 
appointment to talk to a counselor.</p>
<p>It is important to note that you may receive 
a Summons and Complaint even if you have 
begun working with a housing counseling 
agency or with the Bank directly. You may 
be working with the Bank&apos;s &quot;loss mitigation&quot; 
department, which is the group that works 
with struggling homeowners to come up with 
a plan that allows you to keep your home. 
You may have sent in multiple rounds of 
documents to the Bank, and may be hopeful 
that a solution to your problem is just around 
the corner.</p>
<p>However, most large banks have a completely 
separate department that deals with filing 
foreclosures. Therefore, even if you are in 
the process of working with the Bank, the 
Bank still may start a foreclosure against you. 
If that is the case, do not despair. You can 
continue to work with the Bank throughout 
the foreclosure proceeding. So if they have 
asked for more documents, or have told 
you they are reviewing your file, you should 
continue this process!</p>
<p>Once you receive the Summons and 
Complaint, it is <b><u>EXTREMELY</b></u> important that 
you open <b><u>ALL</b></u> mail sent to you by your Bank&apos;s 
attorney, and by the Court. Important notices 
about the status of your case will be mailed 
to you, and it is critical that you be aware of 
these developments.</p>
<p>You will find an example of the fi rst pages of 
a Summons and a Complaint on pages 12 and 13.</p>
