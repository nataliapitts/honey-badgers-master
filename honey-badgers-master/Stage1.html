<h2>STAGE 1: HOMEOWNER FALLS BEHIND IN
PAYMENTS </h2><p> It may be a loss of a job, or a
cut in your pay rate. Perhaps you have just
gone through a divorce, or had a major
medical concern. Whatever the reason is,
you have fallen behind on your mortgage
payments. When this happens, often times
homeowners are put in the no-win situation
of paying all their other bills, or paying their
mortgage. There is really no “right” answer to
this question, because whichever bill doesn’t
get paid has the possibility of leading to
negative consequences. If it is the Mortgage
that doesn’t get paid, the Bank will begin
contacting you to fi nd out when you will
make your missed payments. Homeowners
often will ignore these calls, because they
know they cannot make the payment in the
foreseeable future. Perhaps you are able to
make some payments, so you are always a
month or two behind. Eventually, you fall
behind to the point that the Bank is ready to
threaten you with foreclosure.</p>
