<h1>The Settlement Conference</h1>
<p>At this point in the process, you have now
been made aware through the Summons
and Complaint that the Bank has started a
foreclosure in the Court system. You may
have fi led an Answer or Notice of Appearance,
or you may have decided to skip that optional
step. Either way, the next step in the process
will be the scheduling of a “Settlement
Conference”.</p>
<p>Under New York State law, a Settlement
Conference must be held if you are living
in your 1-to-4 unit home. The idea behind
the Settlement Conference is to protect the
homeowner. By now, many homeowners will
have already contacted the Bank to work out
a solution. However, banks can be incredibly
diffi cult to work with. Homeowners send the
same documents to the Bank many times,
only to have the Bank tell them they never
received them, or that still more documents
are needed. Sometimes, the Bank will take
a long time to review your documents, and
then tell you that the documents are out of
date and therefore you need to send updated
documents again.</p>
<p>The idea behind the Settlement Conference
is to give the homeowner an opportunity
to work with the Bank to come to some
alternative to foreclosure, with the Court’s
help. The general idea is that until the Bank
proves to the Court that they have attempted
to fi nd an alternative to foreclosure, the
Court will not allow the foreclosure to move
forward in the Court system. In this way, the
Settlement Conference can be thought of
as a “safety zone” for homeowners – while
you are in the Settlement Conference phase
of the foreclosure process, the foreclosure
essentially is “frozen” in the Court system.
Therefore, you do not have to worry about
showing up at your house to fi nd the locks
changed, or a notice saying you must be out
of your house in days, or any of the other
horror stories you may have read about from
other parts of the country.</p>
<p>You should receive a letter in the mail from
the Court with the time, date and place of the
Settlement Conference. The notice of your
Settlement Conference typically comes a few
weeks after the Summons and Complaint.
The notice will also list the documents you
should bring with you to the Settlement
Conference.</p>
<p>If you do not show up at your fi rst scheduled
Settlement Conference without contacting
the Court, the Court may declare this stage
of the foreclosure to be over, and allow the
foreclosure to move forward. This is your
best opportunity to work with the Bank and
attempt to save your home, but it only can
work if you take an active part in the process.</p>
<div class="warning">
IT IS VITAL THAT YOU
ATTEND THE FIRST
SCHEDULED SETTLEMENT
CONFERENCE!
</div>
<p>If for some reason you cannot attend the
scheduled Settlement Conference, you will
need to contact the Court to reschedule.
Contact information can be found in the
front folder pocket of this guidebook. You
should do this as soon as you realize there is a
confl ict. If you have received a Summons and
Complaint, but have not received the notice
for a Settlement Conference yet, you should
call the Court and ask if one is scheduled.
Page 15 shows an example of the letter you
will receive from the Court regarding the
scheduling of your Settlement Conference.</p>

<h2>Who Attends a Settlement Conference</h2>
<p>The homeowner can appear at a Settlement
Conference with or without an attorney.
(Appearing without an attorney is referred to
as appearing “pro se”.) The Bank must have
a representative available at the Settlement
Conference. Typically, this will be the Bank’s
attorney.</p>
<h2>What should you expect at a
Settlement Conference?</h2>
<p>The Settlement Conference is your
opportunity to work with the Bank and try
to fi nd an alternative to foreclosure. You
will describe your situation; the Court may
ask questions about your fi nances, your
income and your debts. The Court may also
ask whether you have any savings set aside.
The Bank should be able to describe how
much you owe and how this amount was
calculated. There will be no witnesses or
testimony, it is simply an opportunity for both
sides to ask questions and explore solutions.</p>
<p>The Bank will likely give the homeowner
a packet of forms that must be fi lled out
and returned to the Bank, so that the Bank
can review your loan for a possible “loan
modifi cation.” The forms the Bank asks you
to fi ll out are designed to give the Bank a
snapshot of your current fi nancial situation.
Therefore, they will ask about both your
income and your monthly expenses. Some
of the forms will be specifi c to your Bank,
while others will be forms used by all banks
as required by federal law. In addition,
most banks will ask for your most recent
bank statements and a copy of your income
taxes. Again, this is used to have a better
understanding of your fi nancial situation.</p>
<p>It is very rare that you will be able to come
to an agreement with the Bank at the fi rst
Settlement Conference. What typically
happens is that the Court will schedule
another Settlement Conference for you.</p>
<h2>What are your rights at a
Settlement Conference?</h2>
At the Settlement Conference, you have the
right to:
<ul>
<li>Have a friend, family member, attorney
or advocate assist you;</li>
<li>Have anything explained to you;</li>
<li>Ask for an adjournment (a rescheduling)
of the conference if you cannot attend
for a valid reason</li>
<li>Ask for copies of:</li>
<ul>
<li>Your Note</li>
<li>Your Mortgage</li>
<li>A payment history (so you can review
what payments have been applied and
when)</li>
<li>An explanation of any fees or charges
to your loan</li>
</ul>
</ul>
